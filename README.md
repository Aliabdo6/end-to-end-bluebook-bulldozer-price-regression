# End-to-End Bluebook Bulldozer Price Regression

Welcome to the **End-to-End Bluebook Bulldozer Price Regression** project! This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting bulldozer auction prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of bulldozers at auction using the Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset. The project covers the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Notebook Description

The Jupyter Notebook, `end-to-end-bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb`, is designed to guide you through the following key steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset, identifying missing values, and exploring features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, feature engineering, and preparing it for modeling.
3. **Model Building**: Selecting appropriate machine learning models for regression and tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
5. **Model Deployment**: Demonstrating how to deploy the model for predictions.
